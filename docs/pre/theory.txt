        <h2>Introduction to Fluid Dynamics</h2>
        <p>
            Fluid dynamics is a branch of physics that studies the motion of fluids, including liquids and gases.
            Equations governing fluid flow are crucial for understanding and predicting fluid behavior in various scenarios.

        <h2>Navier-Stokes Equations</h2>
        <p>
            The Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of incompressible fluid substances.
            They are a set of partial differential equations that represent the conservation of momentum and mass for fluid flow.

        <h2>Bernoulli's Equation</h2>
        <p>
            Bernoulli's equation describes the behavior of fluid particles along a streamline.
            It is based on the conservation of energy for fluid flow without viscous effects.
